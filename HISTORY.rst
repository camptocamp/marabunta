  load some different scripts or install different addons for different modes
  (the addons list are merged and the operations of the modes are executed
  after the main ones)::

    - version: 0.0.1
      operations:
        pre:  # executed before 'addons'
          - echo 'pre-operation'
        post:  # executed after 'addons'
          - anthem songs::install
      addons:
        upgrade:
          - base
      modes:
        prod:
          operations:
            pre:
              - echo 'pre-operation executed only when the mode is prod'
            post:
              - anthem songs::load_production_data
        demo:
          operations:

              - anthem songs::load_demo_data
          addons:
            upgrade:
              - demo_addon
