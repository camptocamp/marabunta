"""
Marabunta is a name given to the migration of the legionary ants or to the ants
themselves. Restless, they eat and digest everything in their way.

This tool aims to run migrations for Odoo versions as efficiencly as a
Marabunta migration.

It loads migration instructions from a YAML file and run the operations if
required.
